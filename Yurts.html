<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
<dl>
    <dd><dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt></dd>
Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor,
and a roof dome that can be opened.
</dl>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
    Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes
    electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

<dl>
    <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
    Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to
    bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
